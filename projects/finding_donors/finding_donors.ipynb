    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "### Implementation: Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",
    "| :-: | :-: |                            | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n",
    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

For e.g. the 'Trauma & Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is used to predict mortality in injured patients, was originally developed using Logistic Regression. Similarly this has been used to predict if patient has a certain disease based on observations and characteristics of patient (age, body mass index, sex, blood tests etc.)\n",

    "3. *Weakness* - Doesn't perform well if feature space is too large. Need to be careful about underfitting and overfitting. Relies on transformation of non-linear features.\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "The most appropriate model that I will recommend is **AdaBoost Classifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AdaBoost gave the best performance in terms of accuracy (0.8562) and fscore (0.7210) for full test data than the other algorithms.\n",

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier that we are using here is AdaBoostClassifier (ABC), which uses DecisionTreeClassifier (DTC) as it's base classifier by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as training many DecisionTreeClassifiers on various sub-parts of the training data, and then polling them at prediction time and aggregating their prediction to come up with a string prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good analogy is metacritic.com. It aggregates critic scores from various sources, and combines them to form a single score. That way, the individual biases of each critic get offset-ed and what we get at the end is (supposedly) a balanced score.\n",
    "\n",
    "** At training time **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First ABC creates a bag of training data containing all the training data. The selection is done at random with replacement. This leads to ~60% of unique data, and 40% of repeat data. It then trains the first DTC on that dataset. It then runs prediction on the training data and notes the miss-classifications.\n",
    "2. It then creates another bag, this time ensures the instances which were miss-classified, are given more weighted while sampling (done at random with replacement). It then creates a second DTC, trains it and predicts on the training set.\n",
    "3. Step 2 is repeated many times till we have n number of classifiers as an ensemble. Each ensembled classifier is training iteratively till good score is obtained across on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "** At testing/predicting time **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When prediction is to be made on a testing instance, ABC queries all it's weak ensembled classifiers, get's their predictions and assimilates them in a single score. (For regression, this is typically a mean, and for classification, this is typically a voting process).\n",
    "2. The assimilated score is then returned as the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Notes **\n",
    "1. DecisionTreeClassifier is the default base classifier, but other classifiers can be used as well. But ABC+DTC has been shown to be the best combination.\n",
    "2. These kind of tree based classifiers have the added advantage that once trained, they can produce statistics on the best features which help is classification. "

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
